# **Critical Mass New Grad Submission**

This is my submission for the New Grad web development position with Critical Mass. It includes an outline of my recent projects, some projects that have inspired my lately, and my submission for the coding challenge portion of the assignment.

<br />

# **Work/Project Examples**

My experience as a developer has been purely solo freelance. The 3 projects listed below were built by me from scratch with no template code. While I collaborated closely with clients on these projects where applicable, I was the only developer and all the code in these projects is my own.

## **Face the Earth | Official Site (<a href="https://www.facetheearth.ca">facetheearth.ca</a>)**

**Repository: https://github.com/jadenrose/face-the-earth**

<br />

This is the first production project of mine. It's a full stack Vue application that features an admin login route that allows the client to log into the backend to add/edit/remove content.

<br />

### **Technologies Used**

-   Vue (front end)
-   Express (back end)
-   Mongoose (database ORM)
-   MongoDB (database/CMS)
-   GridFS (file storage & streaming)

<br />

### **Standout Features**

-   Protected admin pages
-   User authentication database (MongoDB)
-   Dynamic content stored in database (MongoDB)
-   Image & Video streaming from MongoDB database using GridFS

<br />

## **Allrose Exteriors | Official Site (<a href="https://www.allroseexteriors.ca">allroseexteriors.ca</a>)**

**Repository: https://github.com/jadenrose/allrose_exteriors**

<br />

This full stack project uses React as a platform for a fully dynamic site where most of the content is stored in a database and rendered programmatically. It features a token-based back end that allows me to use a custom-built tool to compose a JSON-based site structure that is recursively rendered by the front end.

<br />

### **Technologies Used**

-   React/Redux (front end)
-   Express (back end)
-   Mongoose (database ORM)
-   MongoDB (database/CMS)
-   GridFS (file storage & streaming)

<br />

### **Standout Features**

-   Recursive React component rendering
-   Fully dynamic site structure (stored in MongoDB)
-   Image streaming from MongoDB database using GridFS
-   Backend routes for JSON-based site structure and content management

<br />

## **Vanilla JS Task Tracker (<a href="https://jadenrose.github.io/vanilla-js-task-tracker">jadenrose.github.io/vanilla-js-task-tracker</a>)**

**Repository: https://github.com/jadenrose/vanilla-js-task-tracker**

<br />

This is one of my final projects towards my Certificate in Front End Web Development through the University of Calgary. On the surface, it feels very similar to the applications I've built using powerful frameworks like React and Vue, but this uses strictly HTML, CSS (Sass), and JavaScript. My goal with this was to build a modern interactive application without the help of any external libraries or resources . I'm pretty happy with the result.

<br />

### **Technologies Used**

-   HTML
-   JavaScript (ECMA latest)
-   Sass (pre-compiled to CSS)

<br />

### **Standout Features**

-   Create, Display, Edit, and delete tasks (CRUD app)
-   Dynamic form UI based on the task category selected
-   From-scratch drag-and-drop reordering of entered tasks
-   Dynamic rendering without refresh
-   Saves tasks to browser's local storage

<br />

# **Inspiration**

## **Twelve Foot Ninja | Official Website (<a href="https://www.twelvefootninja.com/">twelvefootninja.com</a>)**

This site really took me off guard. It's an incredibly unique site that uses a lot of interesting animations and effects. The sideways scrolling layout is very interesting and surprisingly intuitive. It's a really great showcase of the band's branding and the eye-catching layout. I definitely plan to borrow some of these ideas for my own designs.

### **Standout Features**

-   Strong colour choices
-   Mouse-based parallax effect on images
-   Site is quite responsive and performant despite the fancy effects and large images

<br />

## **EMD Digital (<a href="https://www.emddigital.com.au/">emddigital.com.au</a>)**

Twelve Foot Ninja's site led me down a rabbit hole into the other work that the agency responsible has done. This is their website. Right off the bat, I really like the hero section with the video of the waves and the semi-transparent background masked by the font. This is a really neat idea and it's surprisingly readable even if it's a big unorthodox. Other than the hero section, the rest of the site has some very nice mouseover animations.

### **Standout Features**

-   Unique hero section with font-masked background
-   Smooth mouseover effects
-   Good contrast and readability

<br />

## **DesignCourse (<a href="https://designcourse.com/">designcourse.com</a>)**

There are a lot of really well-designed UI/UX design course websites out there. They sort of need to be well-designed since that's the product that they're selling. That said, I think that Gary Simon's site really sets itself apart from some of the competition. Firstly, I'm a big fan of the colour choice here. Secondly, the use of 3D models in UI/UX design is something that's only recently started to gain popularity. One of my hobbies is 3D modelling with Blender, so I'm very interested to see how 3D art can be used in web design.

### **Standout Features**

-   Beautiful colour choice
-   Unique use of 3D models in design
-   Clean, responsive, and performant design

# **Focus**

### **Weeks 1-2**

I imagine there would be an orientation period as I settle into my role. I would use this time to take a look at the web development work that Critical Mass has done to get an idea of the types of technology the team typically uses. Once I get familiar with the technology, I would work with the team to decide whether I should use this technology or if I should bring my prior knowledge in and work with technologies that I excel at.

<br />

### **Month 1**

My focus during this period will be to try to gauge the needs of my team and where my help is most needed. A lot of direction at this point will probably still be coming from my teammates as I get into the swing of things. I would figure out if I'm lending a hand with existing projects, filling a capacity to take on more projects, or if I'm free to explore my own ideas. Given that the prompt for this README implies that I'd be given free reign to do or learn anything, I'll write under the assumption that this is the case.

<br />

### **Months 2-3**

At this point, I'd probably have built up a design document of various styles and components used across existing products and I would start to design a component library that pulls from existing designs while also bringing my knowledge and experience in to get a fresh look at things. This process usually starts in Figma for me where I'll set up a project and develop a colour palette then begin experimenting with component designs.

Once I have a component designed, I would move to whatever technology I've decided to use and begin coding the components to match my designs. I would rinse and repeat as I come up with more ideas.

If I'm needed on any projects, I would offer my time in developing and coding as well as the components that I have developed thus far. I have a lot of experience with being able to use a template component and style it very differently to be able to cut down on coding and prototype very quickly.

<br />

### **Months 4-6**

This would be more of the same from Months 2-3 but I imagine I would be getting more involved with the team. I would continue designing and developing components and at this point I imagine I would have quite a bit of outside influence to help with ideas. Whether it's a project I'm helping with, or a client of mine, I would take my prior knowledge and apply it to fit the needs of the team

<br />

# **Code Challenge**
